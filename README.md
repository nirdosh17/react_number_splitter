# React Number Splitter
This is simple React project which splits a number into N parts. The algorithm is also shown visually. This project is just for fun and to learn a little bit of React.

You can try changing the values of `inputNumber`, `divisions` and `delay(controls speed of execution)` in `index.js` to see how it works.
```
ReactDOM.render(
  <Board inputNumber={20} divisions={5} delay={20}/>,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
```
